## Presentation by J. Nikander at Worldcon 75, 10.8.2017 18:00-19:30
All personal beliefs - _very simplified_
POV commercial agriculture in developed countries
* Future challenges for food production
	* Climate change -> yield, what, where
		* unknown future, models don’t predict well
		* changes in rainfall patterns, droughts, flooding, distribution of pests and diseases are big problem in intense agriculture and organic production. Farmers know where and what, change. Change in packet information is known to farmers through experience.
	* Population growth -> increase in global demand for food, feed and fibre is expected to grow by 70 %, according to FAO (United Nations)
	* Standard of living increasing -> needs more varied fields and meat
	* Other challenges:
		* Intensive farming drains [correct term: degrades] land
		* Pest management chemicals [are] carelessly used -> resistant pests -> needs more [pest management] chemicals
		* multiple negatives [?]
	
* Sustainable intensification -> improving farming technologies and practices
	* Industrial ecosystem around modern farms
	* Data flows on [across] a modern farm
* Precision Agriculture Vision 2016 [by] ryan.rakestrave@monsanto.com
* Connectivity in Finland [is] good (3G)
* Tractor -> + computer = smart product -> + connection = smart connected product -> product system -> ecosystem? (?]
* [Field size is] tens of hectares in Finland, tops
* [we are] waiting for legislation for [independent, automatic, driverless] tractors  [in Finland]

IoT: Things are physical
* 20 different systems    interfaced = automatically [???]
* Trends
