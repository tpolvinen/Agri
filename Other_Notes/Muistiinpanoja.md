Useita sensoriteknologian ja konenäön sovelluksia rikkakasvien kitkennästä villieläinten havaitsemiseen ja niiden aiheuttamien vaurioiden arviointiin, mutta vain muutamia IoT-ratkaisuita. Monet vaikuttavat reaaliaikaiseen sensorointiin ja / tai konenäköön perustuvilta, samaan tapaan kuin Yaran N-sensori.

MARS - Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms
AGCO GmbH – Fendt
	"There has been much discussion on whether the trend in farm machinery manufacturing will continue towards ever bigger and more powerful individual machines, or to “swarm” solutions, that is, many small machines.

	The Fendt MARS System is the first marketable application of swarm technology in agricultural engineering, and thus presents a completely new solution. The system relies on a number of small, auto-steered and electric units that are deployed for maize drilling. 

	The autonomous units are filled with seed by an operator, who also monitors their operation and who hauls them to the field on a trailer. Operating at very low noise levels and without lights at night, these units are suitable for drilling fields near villages and homes 24 hours a day. Manufactured to a cost-saving concept and weighing as little as 40kg each, the swarm units coordinate their work in the field, reduce compaction and minimize the hazard that big machines pose to humans and the environment. The robots log all job data into the “Cloud”, and communicate with each other and the operator."

Beacon+GPS+Sigfox – Fliegl COUNTER SX / Pöttinger PÖTPRO Guide
Fliegl Agrartechnik GmbH & Pöttinger Landtechnik GmbH

	"So that food manufacturers can verify the route the product takes from the field to the consumer in accordance with the EU regulations, for many years now Fliegl has focused on beacons, which in their original form are small, inexpensive Bluetooth transmitters for machine recognition. With Fliegl COUNTER SX, the beacon technology has been considerably expanded with additional functionalities, enabling an inexpensive, flexible entry into smart farming technologies with major benefits. 

	The COUNTER SX uses the innovative radio technology Sigfox, 3D sensors and GPS, that go beyond previous functionality. With the data radio network, Sigfox is a very inexpensive continuous Internet connection, and therefore provides automatic communication between the machines and the farm independently of mobile networks. It records movements of the machines through the intelligent evaluation of the 3D acceleration and tilt sensors integrated in the beacon. Then it analyses them with corresponding algorithms of a broad range of processes, assigns them and saves and transmits the information collected. 

	Thanks to decreasing unit costs and simplified application integration, beacon technology is recommended for use in agricultural applications. As a universal system, beacons can close a broad range of information and documentation gaps. When a grubber is used, it can, for example, recognize the state of work, transport or break, enabling it to determine detailed operating times. When pressing round bales, it can also record the bale output and the placement location of the bales. However, it can also be used for other applications like theft protection, tracking or temperature monitoring."

Farmdok – automation of agricultural recordings with smartphones
Farmdok GmbH

	"The recording requirements for agricultural operations continue to increase. These present farmers with new challenges, however the data that is documented and processed can also be used to improve company management and operational development. It is always necessary to have complete and plausible data, and the easier the data collection system is to operate, the more likely it is that detailed and accurate information is recorded.

	Farmdok is agricultural software for the mobile and automatic documentation of agricultural data in the field with a smartphone and/or tablet. The innovative sample analysis of cultivation and GPS data enables virtually complete automation of data acquisition. The Farmdok TaskPrediction algorithm measures parameters including operating materials, quantities and machines used. The data to be collected is automatically proposed at the start of each job; as a high probability of the planned measures can be achieved at this point thanks to comprehensive data analysis.

	The WorkCognition algorithm is used for the reliable detection and determination of the cultivated area using a far-reaching driving pattern analysis without the need for geo fences. This enables road and field work to be differentiated, and applied loads to be counted. 

	The farmer benefits from time saved and more convenient recording with minimal operating effort. The easy-to-operate system requires no additional hardware, and therefore enables an inexpensive entry into farm record digitization for farmers, machinery rings or contractors."

Same Deutz–Fahr Deutschland GmbH

	"In the course of additional digitization of agriculture, the majority of large companies try to ensure customer loyalty with corresponding proprietary solutions. In contrast to this, small and medium-sized companies are hardly capable of mastering this technical challenge on their own. However, for farmers themselves the primary focus is also on the critical topics of data security and data sovereignty.

	The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and contractors that combines machines and agricultural software across all manufacturers to simplify operating procedures and improve economic efficiency. Only the user can specify who exchanges which data with whom and for how long. The following always applies: The agrirouter transports data, it does not store it. 

	As a result, all available data is brought together for the first time in cooperation with corresponding farm management systems. The agrirouter therefore makes it easier for the farmer to take a major step toward digitization."
