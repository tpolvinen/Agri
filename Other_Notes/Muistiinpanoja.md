MARS - Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms
AGCO GmbH – Fendt
	There has been much discussion on whether the trend in farm machinery manufacturing will continue towards ever bigger and more powerful individual machines, or to swarm solutions, that is, many small machines.

	The Fendt MARS System is the first marketable application of swarm technology in agricultural engineering, and thus presents a completely new solution. The system relies on a number of small, auto-steered and electric units that are deployed for maize drilling. 

	The autonomous units are filled with seed by an operator, who also monitors their operation and who hauls them to the field on a trailer. Operating at very low noise levels and without lights at night, these units are suitable for drilling fields near villages and homes 24 hours a day. Manufactured to a cost-saving concept and weighing as little as 40kg each, the swarm units coordinate their work in the field, reduce compaction and minimize the hazard that big machines pose to humans and the environment. The robots log all job data into the Cloud, and communicate with each other and the operator.

Beacon+GPS+Sigfox – Fliegl COUNTER SX / Pöttinger PÖTPRO Guide
Fliegl Agrartechnik GmbH & Pöttinger Landtechnik GmbH

	So that food manufacturers can verify the route the product takes from the field to the consumer in accordance with the EU regulations, for many years now Fliegl has focused on beacons, which in their original form are small, inexpensive Bluetooth transmitters for machine recognition. With Fliegl COUNTER SX, the beacon technology has been considerably expanded with additional functionalities, enabling an inexpensive, flexible entry into smart farming technologies with major benefits. 

	The COUNTER SX uses the innovative radio technology Sigfox, 3D sensors and GPS, that go beyond previous functionality. With the data radio network, Sigfox is a very inexpensive continuous Internet connection, and therefore provides automatic communication between the machines and the farm independently of mobile networks. It records movements of the machines through the intelligent evaluation of the 3D acceleration and tilt sensors integrated in the beacon. Then it analyses them with corresponding algorithms of a broad range of processes, assigns them and saves and transmits the information collected. 

	Thanks to decreasing unit costs and simplified application integration, beacon technology is recommended for use in agricultural applications. As a universal system, beacons can close a broad range of information and documentation gaps. When a grubber is used, it can, for example, recognize the state of work, transport or break, enabling it to determine detailed operating times. When pressing round bales, it can also record the bale output and the placement location of the bales. However, it can also be used for other applications like theft protection, tracking or temperature monitoring.

Farmdok – automation of agricultural recordings with smartphones
Farmdok GmbH

	The recording requirements for agricultural operations continue to increase. These present farmers with new challenges, however the data that is documented and processed can also be used to improve company management and operational development. It is always necessary to have complete and plausible data, and the easier the data collection system is to operate, the more likely it is that detailed and accurate information is recorded.

	Farmdok is agricultural software for the mobile and automatic documentation of agricultural data in the field with a smartphone and/or tablet. The innovative sample analysis of cultivation and GPS data enables virtually complete automation of data acquisition. The Farmdok TaskPrediction algorithm measures parameters including operating materials, quantities and machines used. The data to be collected is automatically proposed at the start of each job; as a high probability of the planned measures can be achieved at this point thanks to comprehensive data analysis.

	The WorkCognition algorithm is used for the reliable detection and determination of the cultivated area using a far-reaching driving pattern analysis without the need for geo fences. This enables road and field work to be differentiated, and applied loads to be counted. 

	The farmer benefits from time saved and more convenient recording with minimal operating effort. The easy-to-operate system requires no additional hardware, and therefore enables an inexpensive entry into farm record digitization for farmers, machinery rings or contractors.

	In the course of additional digitization of agriculture, the majority of large companies try to ensure customer loyalty with corresponding proprietary solutions. In contrast to this, small and medium-sized companies are hardly capable of mastering this technical challenge on their own. However, for farmers themselves the primary focus is also on the critical topics of data security and data sovereignty.

	The agrirouter is a universal data exchange platform for farmers and contractors that combines machines and agricultural software across all manufacturers to simplify operating procedures and improve economic efficiency. Only the user can specify who exchanges which data with whom and for how long. The following always applies: The agrirouter transports data, it does not store it. 

	As a result, all available data is brought together for the first time in cooperation with corresponding farm management systems. The agrirouter therefore makes it easier for the farmer to take a major step toward digitization.

Review of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental fields:

The next step was to define search terms and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions, combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

In order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria were considered in the reviewing process.
 Documents published in peer-reviewed conferences, peerreviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering organizations, patents, or technical reports.
 Documents published in English.
 Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive).

The protocol described in the previous section was used to
search, select and evaluate preliminary papers. For the search process,
the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract
and keywords.

In order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria were considered in the reviewing process.

* Documents published in peer-reviewed conferences, peerreviewed
journals, papers from computer science or engineering
organizations, patents, or technical reports.
* Documents published in English.
* Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years
inclusive).

If the main topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study, it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the number of papers found
during the search and to get a small number of high-quality sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase process.

* IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing, i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment. Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. 
* IC based on full reading: in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them.
* IC based on quality analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were discarded:
* * QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT
for agro-industry or environment?
* * QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/
or technologies used to implement the proposed solution?
* * QC3: Does the paper present a state of the art or related
work?
* * QC4: Does the paper present an analysis of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal here was to extract the information needed to answer the
research questions in an objective manner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A review on the practice of big data analysis in agriculture:

The bibliographic analysis in the domain under study involved three steps: (a) collection of related work, (b) filtering of relevant work, and (c) detailed review and analysis of state of the art related work. In the first step, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed from the scientific databases IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect, as well as from the web scientific indexing services Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, 2017) and Google Scholar. As search keywords, we used the following query:

“Big Data” AND [“Precision Agriculture” OR “Smart Farming” OR “Agriculture“]

In this way, we filtered out papers referring to big data but not applied to the agricultural domain. Existing surveys (Wolfert et al., 2017; Nandyala and Kim, 2016; Waga and Rabah, 2014; (Chi et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) were also examined for related work. From this effort, 1330 papers were initially identified. Restricting the search for papers in English only, with at least two citations, the initial number of papers was reduced to 232. Number of citations was recorded based on Google Scholar. An exception was made for papers published in 2016–2017, where zero citations were acceptable.
In the second step, we checked these 232 papers whether they made actual use of big data analysis in some agricultural application.
