  abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, the Internet of things, big data has become one of the hot spots of society, but also a major focus of applied research, made many service sectors to become data-driven organizations, which exploit the value of big data resources to gain competitive advantage. The meteorological department and the Internet online monitoring collected a large number of meteorological data, deeply develop meteorological data value by using big data analysis method, also by comparing the data and model analysis technology. Within this paper, a literature review, surveys and expert interviews were used in this research paradigm, it analyzed the meteorological observation data management service system, proposed a value-driven smart meteorological service model based on big data. The aim of this paper is to construct a value-driven smart meteorological big data service model that includes resource collaboration, technical collaboration, and service collaboration, optimize the meteorological forecast processes. This promotes meteorological related services products more fine, more accurate and longer forecast timeliness in meteorological disaster prevention and mitigation, public transportation, flood control and drought, agricultural production, transportation and other areas.},

  title = {Aggregating {{OPC UA Server}} for {{Remote Access}} to {{Agricultural Work Machines}}},
  url = {http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-201509184356},
  abstract = {Agricultural machinery has improved rapidly during the last decades and the role of electronic controllers and sensors has increased. Simultaneously and partially because of this, the efficiency requirements concerning farming have grown more stringent. Information systems to help in farm management are already commonplace. Many work machines utilize the ISO 11783 communication protocol, through which a lot of data from the operation and internal state of a machine could be retrieved. However, this available data from agricultural work machines is not fully utilized. This thesis evaluates OPC UA aggregating servers as a centralized means to read and store the data available from multiple work machines.
 
 
This thesis builds on an earlier thesis where an OPC UA information model was developed for agricultural work machines utilizing the ISO 11783 communication protocol. First, a literature review was done to get a general view of the current state and the intended future of farm management systems, and to see how and where the data from the work machines can be utilized. Based on this and the previous work, the requirements for an aggregating server concentrating the information available from work machines running OPC UA servers were defined. A prototype aggregating server that is able to automatically transform the information from multiple ISO 11783 work machines to a unified view using a set of mapping rules was designed and implemented.
 
 
OPC UA aggregating servers were found to be viable technology for the centralized data monitoring and collection of ISO 11783 work machines. All relevant data exposed by the work machine OPC UA servers can also be accessed through the aggregating server. The mapping engine implemented on the aggregating server prototype can be extended to automatically map the information from other devices exposing themselves through OPC UA as well. The usefulness of an aggregating server increases if in the future OPC UA will be more commonly adopted and utilized by other agricultural equipment as well.},
