  abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, the Internet of things, big data has become one of the hot spots of society, but also a major focus of applied research, made many service sectors to become data-driven organizations, which exploit the value of big data resources to gain competitive advantage. The meteorological department and the Internet online monitoring collected a large number of meteorological data, deeply develop meteorological data value by using big data analysis method, also by comparing the data and model analysis technology. Within this paper, a literature review, surveys and expert interviews were used in this research paradigm, it analyzed the meteorological observation data management service system, proposed a value-driven smart meteorological service model based on big data. The aim of this paper is to construct a value-driven smart meteorological big data service model that includes resource collaboration, technical collaboration, and service collaboration, optimize the meteorological forecast processes. This promotes meteorological related services products more fine, more accurate and longer forecast timeliness in meteorological disaster prevention and mitigation, public transportation, flood control and drought, agricultural production, transportation and other areas.},
