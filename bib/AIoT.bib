  abstract = {This literature review on Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture and food, provides an overview of
existing applications, enabling technologies and main challenges ahead. The results of the review
show that this subject received attention by the scientific community from 2010 on and the number
of papers has increased since then. The literature on IoT in agriculture and food is very much
dominated by Asian scientists, especially from China. In other continents, the concept of IoT was up
to recently mainly adopted by non-agricultural scientists. The application area of food supply chains is
addressed most frequently, followed by arable farming. Most papers report the results of explorative
studies or they present IoT systems that are designed or implemented in prototypes and pilots. The
literature reviewed focuses on sensing and monitoring, while actuation and remote control is much
less addressed. The findings indicate that IoT is still in its infancy in the agriculture and food domain.
Applications are often fragmentary, lack seamless integration and especially more advanced solutions
are in an experimental stage of development. Important challenges to overcome this situation include
(i) integration of existing IoT solutions by open IoT architectures, platforms and standards,
(ii) upscaling the usage of interoperable IoT technologies beyond early adopters especially by the
simplification of existing solutions and make it more affordable for end users, and (iii) further
improvement of IoT technologies to ensure a broad usability in the diversity of the agri-food domain.},

  abstract = {Internet technologies allow supply chains to use virtualizations dynamically in operational management processes. This will improve support for food companies in dealing with perishable products, unpredictable supply variations and stringent food safety and sustainability requirements. Virtualization enables supply chain actors to monitor, control, plan and optimize business processes remotely and in real-time through the Internet, based on virtual objects instead of observation on-site. This paper analyses the concept of virtual food supply chains from an Internet of Things perspective and proposes an architecture to implement enabling information systems. As a proof of concept, the architecture is applied to a case study of a fish supply chain. These developments are expected to establish a basis for virtual supply chain optimization, simulation and decision support based on on-line operational data. In the Internet of Things food supply chains can become self-adaptive systems in which smart objects operate, decide and learn autonomously.},

This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big) data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four different studies are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used, nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to be overcome.},

  abstract = {Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.},

The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.},

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are taking place on the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an effective and flexible manner. The contemporary B2B collaboration schemes already place the requirements for swift deployment of cloud applications, capable of both integrating diverse legacy systems, as well as developing in a rapid way new services and systems, which will be able to instantly communicate and provide complete, “farm-to-fork” solutions for farmers, agri-food and logistics service providers, ICT companies, end-product producers, etc. To this end, this conceptual paper describes how these requirements are addressed via the FIspace B2B platform, focusing on the Greenhouse Management \&amp; Control scenarios.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

The paper incorporates the best aspects of the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools. It specifically targets the promotion of the "Environmental Observation Web" as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors). Independently from the observation provenance and application scope, data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Processing and Analytics. For example, "the cloud" can satisfy the peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are described with an overall architectural approach for developing environmental applications and exemplar use cases.},

  abstract = {In order to master the future challenges concerning increased demand for food and energy it is obvious that new methods are needed to boost productivity in a sustainable way. One key aspect to optimize agricultural processes and decision making is to derive effective means to acquire and share information along the value chain. In the past, data management in agriculture was dominated by proprietary, mostly Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) driven solutions with limited scope. To overcome the shortcomings associated with this, the German national joint research project iGreen was initiated in 2009 to enable convenient and efficient data sharing in a holistic and OEM independent way. As a project partner, John Deere focused on developing concepts and components for interconnecting machines among each other and with infrastructure nodes. In this paper the achieved results such as the infrastructure component referred to as the machine connector, the onboard data management and integration of mobile devices will be presented and evaluated through experiments focusing on data sharing in wheat and forage harvesting. The overall promising results indicate that in the future new applications focusing on optimizing processes can be enabled that will greatly improve the effectiveness and ease of agricultural production, especially fleet management and resource planning.},

  isbn = {978-952-326-149-5},

  abstract = {Tämän tiekartan tarkoituksena on tarkastella teknologiaa maatalouden ja kasvintuotannon kannalta erityisesti digitalisaatiota silmälläpitäen. Digitalisaatio tulee muuttamaan kaikkia aloja, mutta jokaisella alalla on omia erityispiirteitä sekä haasteitaan. Tämän tiekartan tarkoituksena on selvittää mikä on alan tulevaisuuden visio mihin tulisi pyrkiä sekä tarvittavat kehitys ja tutkimussuunnat mitä alan toimijat tällä hetkellä näkevät tulevaisuudessa tarvittavan vision saavuttamiseksi. Tiekartan osapuolina ovat Suomen Maatalousautomaatio ry:n sekä Teknologiateollisuus ry:n Maatalouskoneiden toimialaryhmän yritysjäsenet sekä kasvintuotantojärjestelmien teknologiaa kehittävät tutkimuslaitokset Aalto-yliopisto, Helsingin yliopisto sekä Luonnonvarakeskus.  Tiekartta on toteutettu keskustelutilaisuuksina eri osapuolten välillä sekä Webpropol kyselyn avulla. Alustavan työn ja tiekartan tutkimus- ja kehitys aihealueiden kokoaminen tapahtui tutkijoiden välisissä keskusteluissa. Eri aihealueiden tärkeyden sekä tämän hetken kehitysvaiheen arviointiin sekä tulevaisuuden visiointiin käytettiin yrityksille suunnattua Webpropol kyselyä. Lopulliset yhteenvedot sekä päätelmät on tehty Luonnonvarakeskuksen tutkijoiden voimin.  Maatalouskoneiden tutkimussäätiö on rahoittanut tiekartan tekemistä osana Finnliner – Peltoviljelyä toteuttava teknologia osahanketta 3: ISOBUSTURVA – Kotimaisen ISOBUS toiminnan turvaaminen ja kehittäminen 2014-2017. Viimeisen kahdenkymmen vuoden aikana viljely on tehostunut sekä koneiden koon kasvaessa, että myös automaation lisääntyessä. Nopeasti yleistyviä teknologioita ovat olleet esimerkiksi ajo-opastimet ja automaattiohjauslaitteet. Suoran hyödyn tuottavuuteen lisäksi yleistymisen syyksi on arveltu johtuvan niiden käytettävyys sekä työn rasittavuuden vähentyminen. Lisääntyvään elektroniikan ja automaation määrään puolestaan on vastannut ISO 11783 standardi, joka on kehitetty tiedon-siirtoon traktorin ja työkoneen välille. Muissa teollisuuden aloissa viimeaikaisin kehitys on ollut hyödyntää kehittyneitä verkkoratkaisuja sekä halventuneita antureita. Koneista saadaan entistä enemmän mitattua dataa, joka voidaan edelleen jalostaa tiedoksi ja uuden tyyppisiksi palveluiksi. Myös koneiden verkottuessa osa niiden toiminnoista voi sijaita erillään koneesta, erilaisissa tuotepilvissä. Todennäköistä on, että myös kasvintuotannossa tullaan seuraamaan muun teollisuuden viitoittamaa tietä ja mahdolliset hyödyt hajautetussa ja heterogeenisessä toimintaympäristössä voivat olla jopa suuremmat kuin muilla teollisuuden aloilla. Tiekartan kyselyiden pohjalta muodostuneessa visiossa nähtiin, että entistä tarkemman, täsmällisemmän ja tarkoituksenmukaisemman kasvien viljelyn vuoksi teknologiaa tullaan kehittämään digitalisaation ja robotiikan suuntaan. Tulevaisuudessa Suomessa tulee olemaan sekä suuria kasvinviljelytiloja, jossa tuotantoa ohjataan teollisuusmaisesti, että pieniä kasvinviljelytiloja, jotka tarvitsevat hieman kevennetyt versiot suurten tilojen koneista ja järjestelmistä. Visiossa robotisaatio tulee muuttamaan myös osaltaan viljelytapaa: mekaaninen kasvinsuojelu muodostaa viljelyn perustan sekä useamman autonomisen yksikön ryhmä korvaa suurten koneiden tarpeen. Maanviljelijän toimenkuva tulee muuttumaan työn suorittajasta työn valvojaksi. Laitteiden monimutkaistuessa myös laitteiden huoltoverkoston, kunnossapidon ja käytön helppouden merkitys tulee korostumaan.  Edellä kuvattuun visioon pääseminen vaatii pitkäjänteistä ja jatkuvaa tutkimusta sekä kehittämistä. Tässä tiekartassa kehitysaskeleet on jaettu kuuteen ryhmään, joissa jokaisessa on yksi tai useampi kehityspolku. Kehityspolulla olevat aiheet jaettiin tuotekehitys-, tutkimus-, pitkän aikavälin tutkimus- sekä akateemisen tutkimuksen vaiheisiin odotettavissa olevan tuotteistusajan mukaan. Tuotteistusvaiheessa olevia tärkeitä aiheita nähtiin kyselyssä olevan perus ISOBUS työkoneohjaimen kehittäminen, ISOBUS tehtävänohjain rajapintojen kehittäminen, kehitysalusta työkoneiden ohjainten kehittämiseen, käyttöliittymän käytettävyyden parantaminen, erilaiset opastuspalvelut sekä elinkaaren hallinnan ja työajan kirjanpidon palvelut.  Yhteensä eri vaiheissa ja tärkeysasteissa olevia aiheita tiekartassa on 33 kappaletta. Tiekartta voidaan yksinkertaistaa yläkäsitteiden avulla: nyt tuotekehityksessä olevat ja toisistaan erillään olevat koneen ohjausjärjestelmät, telematiikka ja palvelut sekä prosessit muodostavat sekoittuessaan kasvinviljelyn teollisen internetin, johon suuri osa tutkimus-vaiheessa olevista aiheista voidaan laskea kuuluvan.  Teollinen internet mahdollistaa automaation ja autonomian tason noston asteittain jolloin lopulta saavutetaan robottien autonomian taso. Haasteena viljelyroboteissa on robotin ja työkoneen luotettavuus sekä toiminnan turvallisuus. Robotin selviytyminen poikkeustilanteista sekä työkoneen vikaantumisista vaatii kehittyneitä päätöksentekojärjestelmiä. Viljelyrobotit ja pienet mittausrobotit (UAV ja UGV) vaativat vielä perustutkimusta sekä toimivaa infrastruktuuria ympärilleen, jotta niitä voitaisiin alkaa soveltaa suuremmassa mittakaavassa sekä maatilalla tapahtuvassa tutkimuksessa. Teknologiaa ei pitäisi kehittää teknologiana, vaan myös tuotantoprosessien tulisi kehittyä ja näiden kehittyminen vaatia uuden teknologian kehittämistä. Käytännössä teknologian ja prosessien kehitys kulkee käsi kädessä ja ne antavat syötettä toisilleen. Kehitystä vaaditaan sekä mittauksessa, mallinnuksessa että itse prosessissa. Sekaviljelyssä ja muissa uusissa tuotantotavoissa tarvitaan systemaattisen tutkimuksen tuloksien tuloksia ja esimerkiksi laajaa datavarastoa erityyppisistä viljelytavoista usealta eri vuodelta. Digitalisaation mahdollistamassa kasvinviljelyn, eläin- ja energiantuotannon integraatiossa materiaalivirtojen ja koneiden käytön optimaalisemmassa resurssien käytössä myös itse toimintatapaa pitää kehittää.  Usean eri aihealueen pitkäjänteinen kehitys ja tutkimus, jossa eri tutkimus- ja kehittämishankkeet seuraavat sekä yhtäaikaisesti olevat tukevat toisiaan, vaatii hallittua hankkeiden tavoitteiden asettelu ja valmistelua. Tämän tiekartan on tarkoitus olla tukena tulevien hankkeiden valmistelussa sekä rahoittajien kanssa käytävissä neuvotteluissa.},
