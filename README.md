# Agri

This repository holds my research plan for a study applications of AIoT-technologies (Agriculture Internet of Things) in Finland. 
This research consistst of only a literature survey for a theoretical background and a single themed interview. 
The purpose of this research is to prepare me for my planned thesis on the same or like subject.
As a side note, I'm also testing a few workflows and tools like Pandoc and Zotero for scientific writing to make the writing of my thesis a bit more bearable.
And the rest, as they say, is in Finnish.
